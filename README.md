# Mod-17

Overview:
Credit risk is an inherently unbalanced classification problem, as good loans easily outnumber risky loans.

Results: Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.

Oversampling
  We were able to train the data to adjust the class distribution of data.
  
Na√Øve Random Oversampling
  Trained the data and calculate with random oversampling.
  
SMOTE Oversampling
  Trained the data using logistic regression model using the resampled date.
  
Undersampling

Combination Over & Under Sampling
  Test a combination over- and under-sampling algorithm to determine if the algorithm results in the best performance compared to the other sampling algorithms above. 

Summary: 
  I favored using the oversampling model, using the training, converting the targets the results were good.
